## What This Package Provides

- **Same crawler as every binding** — one Rust engine behind Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, Java, .NET, PHP, Elixir, Dart, Kotlin Android, Swift, Zig, WASM, and C FFI.
- **Structured scrape output** — HTML, Markdown, metadata, links, assets, response headers, and extraction warnings with consistent field names.
- **Crawl controls** — depth, page limits, concurrency, URL filters, robots/sitemap handling, rate limits, and partial failure reporting.
- **Rendering path** — optional browser rendering for JavaScript-heavy pages; direct HTTP path for fast static pages.
